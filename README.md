RapGuessingGame
===============
scraper.js scrapes all songs for a given artist and saves them to a local Mongo DB instance.
There is a browser based game which requires the player to select an artist. The player is then
given five multiple choice questions, each containing for consecutive lines from a song and a
selection of four songs to choose from.
Rationale
=========
This project was created whilst I was at Hackerschool (Fall '13) to get a better understanding
of the MEAN stack. Hackerschool is based in NYC, so what better place than the home of hip-hop
to create a game based on rap lyrics!
Additional Features
===================
I will work on the following features when I get the chance:
* Refactor code base
* Use Mongoose ORM
* Incorporate Angular.js
